## Usage
- Open the `.sln` file
- Make sure that you are on `Debug` and `x64`
- Build & add features!

You should have a `.dll` (dynamic link library) produced, use a dll injector to execute the code into a process, this should render a menu, by default it's toggleable with the `DEL` key and and uninjectable with the pre-coded button. 

- If your menu isn't appearing than an anticheat may be blocking it from loading, to evade this make sure that you have `-insecure` and `-allow_third_party_software` enabled.
- Make sure that your game is on "Windowed Fullscreen" or the menu may not render properly.
