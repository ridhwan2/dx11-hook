# About
Hooks the dx11 [present method](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/nf-dxgi-idxgiswapchain-present) to render a gui internally

![menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1100164162295959555/1163125073247481906/cmXblhbWXbvnrerV8tqTAkgJLCiwpsKTAkgJLCuxLCiyB1L6c9uWglxRYUmBJgSUFlhRYUqALCiyBVBdUXNaxpMCSAksKLCmwpMCSAvuSAksgtSnfTnoJQWWFFhSYEmBJQWWFOiCAksg1QUVl3UsKbCkwJICSwosKbCkwL6kwP8PfiL6mFQC1V8AAAAASUVORK5CYII.png?ex=653e6fa3&is=652bfaa3&hm=45166019dd00289495dff83bd9172f6009f75ea6bd0c1a68ad75cba38a508a33&)

## Usage
- Open the `.sln` file
- Make sure that you are on `Debug` and `x64`
- Build


You should have a `.dll` (dynamic link library) produced, use a dll injector to execute the code into a process, this should render a menu, by default it's toggleable with the `DEL` key and and uninjectable with the pre-coded button.

To interact and change the GUI to what suits you best locate [this](https://github.com/ridhwan2/dx11-hook/blob/main/main.cpp#L81) section of the code, (you may have to scroll a little)
