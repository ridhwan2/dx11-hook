# About
Renders a gui by internally hooking [DirectX11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX)

## Usage
- Open the `.sln` file
- Make sure that you are on `Debug` and `x64`
- Build & add features!

You should have a `.dll` (dynamic link library) produced, use a dll injector to execute the code into a process, this should render a menu, by default it's toggleable with the `DEL` key and and uninjectable with the pre-coded button. 

- If your menu isn't opening make sure that your games anticheat isn't blocking any WinAPI calls made by basic/pasted injectors.
- Make sure that your game is on "Windowed Fullscreen" for the overlay to render correctly.
